Welcome to the Death and the Digital Estate (DADE) GitHub repo.  

The DADE repo exists so that the community can develop a charter to designed to establish a DADE community group (CG) within the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net).  The goal of the proposed DADE CG is to develop the use cases and high level data flows required to enable individuals to inform service providers how to handle their data upon their death or if they are unable to manage their own data temporarily or permanently.  The consent-based mechanism should allow users to manage their data through preservation (e.g. public social media accounts), delegation of authority/responsibility to others, and deletion of data.  

The proposed DADE CG will not deliver protocols, data formats, or other technical means of implementation.  If successful, the DADE CG's output will inform a future working group.
