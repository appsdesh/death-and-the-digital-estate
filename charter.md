# Death & The Digital Estate Community Group Charter -- Draft

## Introduction

In today's digital age, the internet permeates nearly every aspect of our lives, from social interactions and commerce to accessing news and entertainment. However, amidst this digital revolution, a critical issue persists: the lack of tools for individuals to determine the fate of their digital accounts and data after their demise or incapacitation. While some mechanisms exist, they are inconsistently available and often require individual configuration across various service providers—an arduous task beyond the reach of many.

This glaring gap underscores the pressing need for more effective mechanisms for individuals to consent to the handling of their digital estate upon death or disablement. At its core, this issue transcends mere technological convenience; it is a matter of human rights—the right of individuals to manage their data and likeness, even when they are no longer able to do so themselves. As stewards of digital innovation, it is our duty to address this fundamental need and provide individuals with the agency they deserve over their digital legacies.

## Current State

1. What happens today if a user dies and doesn't have a digital estate?
2. What tools are available today (look at providers like Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, X)
3. 
4. 

## Long Term Vision

The long term vision beyond the scope of the proposed community group is to develop protocols and guidance that is freely available for use by service providers to establish improved online tools for humans to manage their digital estate. The vision includes user-centric, centralized mechanisms for determining the handling of the user's data (in bulk), enabling both coarse and fine-grained controls to share, place data in escrow, delete data, delegate access to credentials/data/services in a way that protects the individual's privacy rights. Our long-term vision entails fostering a regulatory framework that ensures individuals' rights to manage their digital legacies are upheld effectively. By empowering individuals to exert control over their digital assets, we aim to instill confidence and provide clarity in digital data management, thereby mitigating potential legal and emotional burdens.

## Community Group Goals & Organizing Principles

1. **Empowerment through Consent:** Facilitate informed decision-making by individuals regarding the management of their digital assets through comprehensive consent mechanisms.
   
2. **Privacy and Security:** Strengthen privacy and security protocols to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access or misuse of digital data during periods of incapacity or posthumously.
   
3. **Interoperability and Accessibility:** Promote interoperability among digital platforms to facilitate seamless data management and accessibility across diverse ecosystems, ensuring inclusivity and efficiency.
   
4. **Education and Awareness:** Undertake initiatives to enhance public awareness regarding the significance of digital consent and the potential consequences of unregulated digital legacies, thereby empowering individuals to assert control over their digital assets proactively.

## Planned Deliverables

1. Development of standardized protocols for digital consent mechanisms.
   
2. Implementation of enhanced privacy and security standards for digital data management.
   
3. Promotion of interoperability among digital platforms to facilitate seamless data accessibility.
   
4. Execution of educational initiatives aimed at raising awareness and empowering individuals to assert control over their digital legacies effectively.

In conclusion, the Digital Data Consent Community Group endeavors to shape a future where individuals retain autonomy and dignity over their digital legacies. By collaborating with stakeholders across diverse sectors, we aim to establish standardized practices that reflect the evolving needs of individuals in the digital era.
